states which is a list of objects.
The objects, which are the states, have 3 things
    name, intents, patterns
name = string
intents = object
patterns = array of strings

intents has responses, actions, and args. They are each an array of strings
    Actions and args must be the same length
    example
        "actions": [
            "say",
            "set_state"
        ],
        "args": [
            "",
            "STATE_QUESTION"
        ]

    actions must be chosen from a drop down menu
    "set_state" "set_entity" "say" "goto_intent"

    So what you can do is make it so that you start with  space for 1 action and 1 corresponding arg then u can click a + or whatever

    patterns can be in one text area thing
